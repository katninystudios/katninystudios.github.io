      <p>Hey, so more info about TransSocial (2022), like I promised on our About Us page!</p>
      <p>TransSocial (2022) was an experiment. I was just curious basically on how it'd work under my own terms (well... kinda. We'll get to that).</p>
      <p>So I checked out tribe.so (now known as Bettermode), a no-code community builder. I named it, created a theme and threw it online as a beta.</p>
      <p>I got positive feedback, so I launched it outside of beta as "TransSocial" with the most blinding theme known to man (you can check it out on TransSocial, it's "TransSocial Classic").</p>
      <p>It did pretty well for a few months, I even got someone else to help me with it! This someone, named Eliza, spent $1,400 on it.</p>
      <p>We added things that were well received (like DMs) and things that were not so well received like a swear word filter (yea... like EVERY single swear word, we won't do that again).</p>
      <p>16 days after Eliza spent all that, TransSocial (2022) was shut down to be <a href="/about/transsocial-2023">seen again in 2023</a>.</p>
      <p>Why were we shut down if Bettermode is still available? I wish I knew. I seriously do. I just woke up one day and it was offline.</p>
