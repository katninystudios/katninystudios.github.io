      <h2><i>Technically</i> founded in 2021</h2>
      <p>We first appeared on the web under the name <i>Pointblank Studios</i> in 2021, we focused on story-focused shooter games, like the <a href="/about/blade-space-trilogy">Blade Space Trilogy</a>. At this time, our only mission was to make fun games, but I was new to coding and making games in general, so they weren't good (or very fun, but a little bit).</p>
      
      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Pointblank Studios died in 2022 and got replaced with <i>Muloo Studios</i>. However, we didn't do anything under the name Muloo Studios, besides added "pls don't steal my assets/code" to our description.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">But, also in 2022, I rebranded to katniny and got some followers on Twitter. Some random day (May 29, 2022 to be exact), I made a post with a link asking for feedback on something I was working on, but I might not keep it around. However, I got lots of positive feedback and kept it around, releasing it outside of beta. This was the 2022 version of TransSocial, which shut down in July of 2022 but not by choice. We just thought that it was "some downtime" (<a href="https://x.com/TransS_ocial/status/1551830641833979905" target="_blank">it was not</a>). <a href="/about/transsocial-2022">More information here</a>!</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">On November 3, 2022, I re-released TransSocial again, but this time it was more forum-like. Besides that, it was mostly the same. We changed logos and our slogan during this time though! But on April 9, 2023, <a href="https://x.com/TransS_ocial/status/1645183124580491264" target="_blank">we received some not-so-good news</a>. We had 2 months to migrate, or else we would get shut down. It was then that I decided TransSocial is going to be independent, rather than dependent. <a href="https://x.com/TransS_ocial/status/1665577939709091841" target="_blank">TransSocial 2023 was shut down June 4, 2023</a>. <a href="/about/transsocial-2023">More information here</a>!</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">On September 10, 2023, we opened pre-registration for a <a href="https://x.com/TransS_ocial/status/1700940124165398534">brand-new era of TransSocial, an independent one</a>.</p>
      
      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">On April 11, 2024, <a href="https://x.com/TransS_ocial/status/1778592400836788638">we released TransSocial</a> independently, rather than depending on a third party, where we continue now! And where we will always continue to be, no more shutdowns.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">And what does that story have anything to do with our founding? Well, because TransSocial is the reason our mission exists, why <i>we</i> exist. TransSocial reignited my spark for development and reignited my love for coding. Why I tried to do ambitious things to give you all a privacy-focused alternative to things that exist, like Facebook, and at some point Windows (<a href="/about/katos">no, seriously</a>).</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">We hope to keep growing financially, with volunteers, and hopefully some day with employees so we can be the Proton of social media, operating systems, search engines, and more (I promise we won't be an illegal monopoly though ðŸ˜…).</p>

      <br />
      <br />

      <h2>Why privacy? So many people promise this already</h2>
      <p>We know, but it seems most privacy-focused alternatives to things have something shady going on. Pushing harmful AI/Crypto, making deals with Google/Microsoft... etc.</p>
      <p>We want to be the alternative to that. While we don't have many products <b>yet</b>, we hope to one day and we hope to be the ultimate privacy-focused alternative to most things.</p>
      <p class="description">Plus, even Google promises privacy... why fall for lies when you have the truth?</p>
