      <p>A hypercasual shape collecting game that gets faster and harder as you go.</p>
      <p>Oh no! Shape Monster is in trouble! He has to collect as many shapes as possible while avoiding bombs! He only has three lives, if that reaches zero, he has to restart! Can you try and help him?</p>

      <p>This game was made for my littlest sister when she was 4! She loved it then (because I think most 4 year olds would), but unsure about now, she hasn't played it in years.</p>
