      <p>Play as Emily Farfield during an alien invasion, where you steal a RASA spaceship and install turrets on it to go to the mothership, and eliminate all the aliens.</p>
      <p>After eliminating all the aliens, the people you just saved now want to kill you, so now you must kill them.</p>

      <br />

      <p>These games had multiplayer (my first games had multiplayer and I haven't done it since, wow), but servers were shut down 6/7/21, sorry to my one fan of the Space Trilogy.</p>
      <p>These games is no longer available for download.</p>
