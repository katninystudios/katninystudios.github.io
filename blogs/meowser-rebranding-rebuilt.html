         <h1>The Future of Meowser</h1>

      <p>Once upon a time, there was a browser named Meowser. It was cute, it was fun, and well... it also sounded like a certain Nintendo character with a catty appearance.</p>
      <p>While I love a good cat pun, I figured it was tie for something more distinct, recognizaable, and let's be honest - less likely to result in a cease-and-desist letter from Nintendo.</p>
      <p>So, say hello to Kairo!</p>

      <br />

      <h2>Why the Change?</h2>
      <p>Meowser was always meant to be a browser that put users first, with privacy, customization, and control at its core. But as I kept working on it, I realized that the current codebase wasn't just messy, it was holding the project back. Debugging was difficult, adding new features felt like duct-taping a spaceship together, and at some point, I had to admit... it was time to start fresh.</p>

      <br />

      <h2>What makes Kairo different?</h2>
      <p>With Kairo, I'm finally making the browser I envisioned from the start:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>âœ… <strong>Full-Fledged Browser</strong> - not just a side project, but something built to compete</li>
         <li>âœ… <strong>Sync</strong> - your data, your way, across all your devices</li>
         <li>âœ… <strong>Browser Extension Support</strong> - originally, I was going to make my own extension API, but then I thought, <i>why reinvent the wheel?</i> so now, Kairo will support Manifest v2 & v3 extensions right out of the box</li>
         <li>âœ… <strong>Built-in & User-Created Themes</strong> - customize your browser how you want</li>
         <li>âœ… <strong>Download Manager & Bookmarks</strong> - because, you know, essentials</li>
         <li>âœ… <strong>Cross-Platform Support</strong> - Coming to Windows, macOS, Linux and Android</li>
         <li>âœ… <strong>Privacy-first Browsing</strong> - built-in adblocking & tracker blocker for a cleaner, more private web</li>
         <li>âœ… <strong>and more to come!</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <br />

      <h2>Goodbye Meowser, Hello Kairo</h2>
      <p>Starting <b>immediately, Meowser will no longer be supported</b>. While it had a good run (for its 2 updates..), it's time to move forward. For those who want to check out the old codebase, it will remain archived at:</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/katninystudios/meowser">ðŸ”— katninystudios/meowser</a> (for archival purposes only)
      <p>Kairo is still in active development, but this time, it's being built with better structure, more flexibility, and a clearer vision. The goal? To make a browser that's actually fun to use, not just another Chromium clone with a different logo.</p>
      
      <br />

      <h2>Thank you for your support</h2>
      <p>A big thank you to anyone who tried out Meowser, even if it didn't quite catch on. I appreciate the curiosity and support throughout. With Kairo, we're taking things to the next level, and I'm excited for what's to come (and I hope you are too!). Stay tuned for a browser that's built to fit the future!</p>
