         <p>A graphical OS built for privacy.</p>

      <p>KatOS would be a graphical OS built for privacy, but also functionality.</p>
      <p>It'd be a great alternative to Windows and Linux, as I would ensure it can run Windows and Linux apps as well as our own custom file type.</p>
      <p>Unlike Windows, it would not require a user account.</p>
      <p>I actually have attempted this already and have gotten a kernel and bootloader to work (not quite graphical though), but it just isn't feasible by myself yet.</p>
      <p>I also tried to compile the Linux kernel for it, but it whined at me.</p>
      <p>So one day, I'll just do it myself (or with a team, who knows) and make it the best alternative you can choose.</p>
