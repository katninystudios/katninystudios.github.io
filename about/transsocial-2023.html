      <p>Hey, so more info about TransSocial (2023), like I promised on our About Us page!</p>
      <p>TransSocial (2023) was a re-release of the previously shut down <a href="/about/transsocial-2022">TransSocial (2022)</a>, but instead of tribe.so, we were using Peerboard.</p>
      <p>This version was less like a standard social media you're used to, and was more forum-like, where notes had a title and body, like you see on Reddit.</p>
      <p>This version was a lot better (and stable...and inexpensive) compared to TransSocial (2022). However, due to me being broke and Eliza being less active (but still active), I was unable to get a Peerboard plan and was stuck on Peerboard Free.</p>
      <p>Though, I still did what I could. Re-introduced DMs, renamed "Posts" to "Notes" (like it still is today), "Like" to "Love" (like it is today), finally removed Facebook as a login option.</p>
      <p>This version doesn't have much to talk about, but the development side kinda did.</p>
      <p>I wanted to release a new TransSocial version - TransSocial v1.2.0, a version I promised for months. It would be off of Peerboard, but still contain the user data we have now.</p>
      <p>I started from scratch working on it, while the volunteers looked into our own <a href="https://github.com/TransSocial/misskey" target="_blank">Misskey fork</a>.</p>
      <p>Misskey didn't happen, which means we didn't join Activitypub, but my plan did end up working out eventually.</p>
      <p>But, on April 9, 2023, we received news that Peerboard was bought out and the company that bought it was shutting it down (why buy a company to shut it down?), but Peerboard gave us a 2 month grace period to get user data, migrate off, etc.</p>
      <p>I restarted development on v1.2.0 several times during this period to make it perfect, but before I knew it, TransSocial (2023) was gone.</p>
      <p>During this time and April 11, 2024, the volunteers, while we're all in the Discord server still (surprisingly), no longer operate on TransSocial. I worked on v1.2.0 independently (but it didn't end up being v1.2.0, but a barebones release of TransSocial v0.0.1-indev), and do still mostly operate TransSocial by myself but <a href="https://lunahd.neocities.org/" target="_blank">lunahd</a> helps!</p>
      <p>But then, on April 11, 2024, <a href="/about/transsocial">the current TransSocial released</a>, independently and will not experience another shutdown (ever).</p>
